# Project Money Tracker
A simple app to manage money that a client have to give you. It's an Electron app and it's my first app made with Electron. 

## Functions
It's possible to create projects with a given budget. After a project has been created, it's possible to create deposits, associating a date to it. There is a simple graph that shows you how much you have to take and how much a client has given to you for each project.
